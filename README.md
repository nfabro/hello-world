# hello-world
This is me learning how to use GitHub using the instructions from https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/

My name is Noel Fabro and I'm an aspiring to be a Web Developer.
I want to study and commit myself into learning the craft and best practices of web development.
I have completed Certificate IV in Web Based Technologies and Diploma for Web Development in TAFE NSW.
However, I find myself still not having enough skills to pursue a career change.
So today, I will document my progress.
